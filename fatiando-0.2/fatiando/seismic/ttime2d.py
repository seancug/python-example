    Calculate the travel times inside a mesh of square cells between source and
    receiver pairs assuming the rays are straight lines (no refraction or
    reflection).

    .. note:: Don't care about the units as long they are compatible.

    For a homogeneous model, *cells* can be a list with only one big cell.

    Parameters:

    * cells : list of :func:`fatiando.mesher.Square`
        The velocity model to use to trace the straight rays. Cells must have
        the physical property given in parameter *prop*. This will be used
        as the velocity of each cell. (*cells* can also be a
        :class:`~fatiando.mesher.SquareMesh`)
    * prop : str
        Which physical property of the cells to use as velocity.
        Normaly one would choose ``'vp'`` or ``'vs'``
    * srcs : list fo lists
        List with [x, y] coordinate pairs of the wave sources.
    * recs : list fo lists
        List with [x, y] coordinate pairs of the receivers sources
    * velocity : float or None
        If not None, will use this value instead of the prop of cells as the
        velocity. Useful when building sensitivity matrices (use velocity = 1).
    * par : True or False
        If True, will run the calculations in parallel using all the cores
        available. Not recommended for Jacobian matrix building!

    *srcs* and *recs* are lists of source-receiver pairs. Each source in *srcs*
    is associated with the corresponding receiver in *recs* for a given travel
    time.

    For example::

        >>> # One source was recorded at 3 receivers.
        >>> # The medium is homogeneous and can be
        >>> # represented by a single Square
        >>> from fatiando.mesher import Square
        >>> cells = [Square([0, 10, 0, 10], {'vp':2})]
        >>> src = (5, 0)
        >>> srcs = [src, src, src]
        >>> recs = [(0, 0), (5, 10), (10, 0)]
        >>> print straight(cells, 'vp', srcs, recs)
        [ 2.5  5.   2.5]

    Returns:

    * times : array
        The total times each ray took to get from a source to a receiver (in
        compatible units with *prop*)
